This is a task manager app that I made to learn more about ReactTS, Tauri and stuff. This is the second app that I have ever made with React and Tauri. It's a simple To-do list app. UI and colors aren't that good, but that wasn't my focus for this app.

I still have to add persistent app state. Right now, when you close the app, the tasks don't save
